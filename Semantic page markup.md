# Semantic page markup: h1, h2, h3, ...

Use the HTML elements to your advantage: h1 headers for your most important titles, h2 for the next level titles, h3 for the next ones, and so on. Google parses your content and uses those tags as its guideline.

Semantic markup goes  [a lot further](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/semantic-markup/)  than just h1 tags though. If you're an event- or booking-site, you can add structured data to your markup that can be parsed and shown directly into Google's search result pages.
