    <HTML>
      <title> Mailing List Archive - MARC</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A public mailing list archive for open source projects.">
      ...

Every page should have a unique, clear title with a proper description. This is the entry ticket form the SERPs (Search Engine Result Pages). The title & description should be considered a teaser to lure the user into clicking your link.
